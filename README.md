# Interview Submission

This is my attempt to replicate the MyInsights Dashboard. 

## Running the Application

When cloning or downloading this repository, please install the packages typing `npm i` into the terminal. After this, you can run `npm start` (make sure you're in the project directory), which will run the app locally. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Additional features

For bonus credit, I applied a function that randomised the data set for each of the bars and circle chart in the Dashboard when reloading the page or clicking on these components. When clicking on the components, the data will be randomised and there will be a transition effect that changes the width accordingly.
